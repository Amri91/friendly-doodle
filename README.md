An example of ASP.NET Web API using a simple ADO.NET library and stored procedures.

I was requested to create this app using LiteADO.NET library. The app contains examples of using action filters, repositories, stored procedures and more.
I hope it can help.

Feel free to contribute or use the code. If you have any questions, let me know.
